                    <h3>Why Traffic Labb Exists</h3>
                    <p>Traffic Labb was founded by a traffic engineer who experienced firsthand the limitations of traditional analysis methods. An engineer peer had tried to model a school pickup queue using standard formulas, but it was clear they weren't confident in their reporting.</p>
                    <p>Analysis of their work revealed errors in both the inputs and formulae used. Learning the fundamentals of queue theory was enlightening and resulted in production of basic tools and spreasheets to handle simple situations.</p>
                    <p>However, as projects grew in complexity, the formulas were insufficient for capturing the variability and uncertainty inherent in real-world traffic systems such as minimum headways, bi-directional flows or carlifts.</p>
                    <p>If one engineer had an issue then many more would probably have the same. Traffic Labb began as a Monte Carlo simulation and has grown into a suite of tools to help engineers with analysis and presentation.</p>

                <p>Give traffic engineers the tools they actually need: statistical reliability for complex scenarios, confidence intervals that mean something, indirect data that formulae in a spreadsheet can't provide.</p>

            <h2>Founded by a Traffic Engineer</h2>
            <div class="glass-panel">
                <p>Traffic Labb was created by Peter Kingsley, an Australian traffic engineer who developed his expertise under the guidance of respected expert Mr Craig McLaren. Peter saw a critical gap between the tools available and the complexity of real-world problems. After years of working on a multitude of niche analyses it became clear that the industry often relied on oversimplified formulas that couldn't always capture the reality of traffic systems.</p>
                <p>The breakthrough came from applying microsimulation (monte carlo style) methods to a wider range of traffic engineering scenarios. By running millions of iterations with realistic distributions, we could finally examine real-world situations such as two-way passing on single lane road segments in intricate detail.</p>
                <p>Spreadsheets can do a lot, but Traffic Labb can do a lot more.</p>
